# Event Drop | CKBULL Hackathon ðŸ’»

Event Drop allows event creators to create unique experiences for their attendees. Attendees will be able to remember and prove their participation in amazing events.

POAP (Proof-of-Attendance) is a protocol that has become very popular in recent years, allowing event attendees to have an NFT as a symbol of participation, referring to badges or participation certificates.

Event Drop harnesses the potential of Common Knowledge Base, to allow event organizers to award POAPs as a symbol of participation to their attendees, thus improving their experience and providing an incentive to participate.

Event Drop consists of three sections:

- Minting & Organizer Viewer page
- Claim page
- NFT Viewer page

Also for easy user identification and management we use [CKBull signer API](https://docs.ckbull.app/) to integrate CKBull Wallet.
